# Acknowledgement 
The content below is something I have learnt from my course work at iNeuron during upskilling myself. I have my last employer, Constacloud by my side to push me learn more on data science. Learning about this topic would be a mess if I did'nt came across Sentdex's Youtube channel, Krish Naik's Youtube channel and MIT opencourseware. Please feel free to copy/fork my work even without acknowledgement. You can communicate with me on shreyanshd46@gmail.com with subject as 'Github | Repository name | Doubts types'. <br/>
